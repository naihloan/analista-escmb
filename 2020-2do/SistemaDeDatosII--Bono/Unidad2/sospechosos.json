Investigative assistance in this matter was provided by the FBI Baltimore Field Office.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Two suspects, believed to be aware of the library’s security procedures, broke into the library and smashed a display case in the lobby. The display case contained three ceremonial swords and two daggers that had been given to President Truman by the Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Saud and the Shah of Iran.<br /> <br />The theft took just minutes, and the suspects fled the building through a window. The items stolen were valued between $700,000 and $1,000,000 in 1978.</p>",

Raush was reported missing on January 31, 2014, when his significant other was unable to locate him. Raush suffers from mental illness and has had contact with law enforcement on multiple occasions due to mental health episodes. Some of this law enforcement contact occurred on highways and near railroad tracks while Philip was on foot. Record checks indicate law enforcement agencies in Southern California queried Raush between January 2, 2014, and October 17, 2014, but the reasons for these queries and whether Raush was physically present at the time are unknown. Investigators have utilized Raush’s name and social security in efforts to locate him in a mental health or corrections facility to no avail. Investigators ask that all agencies review their cases to identify any possible contact with an individual matching the description of Raush.</p>",

To persuade the women to participate, Pratt and his co-conspirators allegedly convinced the women they would remain anonymous, that their videos ?would be provided to private collectors on DVD, and would not be posted on the Internet. Pratt allegedly paid other young women working at his direction to act as references or provide false assurances to the women that, if they filmed a video, the video would not be posted online. Some ?women were not permitted to leave the shooting locations until the videos were made ?and ?others were allegedly forced to perform certain sex acts they had declined to do. Allegedly, some of the women were sexually assaulted.  ?Pratt's pornography websites generated more than $17 million U.S. dollars in revenue.  A federal arrest warrant was issued for Pratt in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, on November 6, 2019. </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

On July 4, 1981, David's dismembered remains began to be discovered in and along the Snake River six miles west of Clarkston, Washington, in an area just west of Silcott Island. Some, but not all, of the remains were recovered elsewhere along the river the next day. The remains had been concealed inside black plastic bags and some of the body parts were wrapped in pages from various April 1981 editions of the local newspaper. David’s blue 10-speed bicycle, clothing, and other personal items were never recovered. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Early in the investigation, multiple individuals traveling Highway 95 on the day of David’s disappearance reported seeing a female cyclist matching David’s description being approached by a man driving a brown van on the west, or southbound, side of the highway just outside Genesee, Idaho. Additional reports suggest the same man also spoke with or approached different female cyclists or pedestrians along Highway 95 the same day. </p>",

Pratt and a co-conspirator owned and operated a pornography production company and online pornography websites, \"GirlsDoPorn\" and \"GirlsDoToys.\" Pratt and his co-conspirators allegedly recruited young women from around the United States by posting advertisements for clothed modeling jobs on the Internet. Pratt and his co-conspirators advised the women responding to the ads that the jobs were in fact for pornographic videos and that they would be paid between $3,000 to $5,000 U.S. dollars for a one-day video shoot. To persuade the women to participate, Pratt and his co-conspirators allegedly convinced the women they would remain anonymous, that their videos ?would be provided to private collectors on DVD, and would not be posted on the Internet. Pratt allegedly paid other young women working at his direction to act as references or provide false assurances to the women that, if they filmed a video, the video would not be posted online. Some ?women were not permitted to leave the shooting locations until the videos were made ?and ?others were allegedly forced to perform certain sex acts they had declined to do. Allegedly, some of the women were sexually assaulted.  ?Pratt's pornography websites generated more than $17 million U.S. dollars in revenue.  A federal arrest warrant was issued for Pratt in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, on November 6, 2019. </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The charges relate to the actions by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to target Iranian dissidents. The regime views these dissidents as enemies of the state because of their criticism of the regime’s human rights violations, and their public statements against the Iranian Government. Since at least approximately 2019, the Government of Iran has allegedly lured several expatriate Iranian dissidents to locations where they were arrested or kidnapped and sent to Iran for imprisonment and execution.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The men also allegedly conspired to kidnap and/or lure a United States citizen, as well as victims residing in other countries. They allegedly hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on an individual in furtherance of a plot to kidnap or harm the victim based on their anti-regime activism. Farahani is an Iranian intelligence official who allegedly manages a network of sources for Iranian intelligence, including Mahmoud Khazein, Omid Noori, and Kiya Sadeghi.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In July of 2021, Farahani, Sadeghi, Khazein, and Noori were indicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on the charges listed above and federal warrants were issued for their arrests.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The charges relate to the actions by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to target Iranian dissidents. The regime views these dissidents as enemies of the state because of their criticism of the regime’s human rights violations, and their public statements against the Iranian Government. Since at least approximately 2019, the Government of Iran has allegedly lured several expatriate Iranian dissidents to locations where they were arrested or kidnapped and sent to Iran for imprisonment and execution.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The men also allegedly conspired to kidnap and/or lure a United States citizen, as well as victims residing in other countries. They allegedly hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on an individual in furtherance of a plot to kidnap or harm the victim based on their anti-regime activism. Sadeghi allegedly facilitated payments and communications to a private investigator in the United States in furtherance of the kidnapping plot.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In July of 2021, Sadeghi, Khazein, Noori, and Farahani were indicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on the charges listed above and federal warrants were issued for their arrests. </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The charges relate to the actions by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to target Iranian dissidents. The regime views these dissidents as enemies of the state because of their criticism of the regime’s human rights violations, and their public statements against the Iranian Government. Since at least approximately 2019, the Government of Iran has allegedly lured several expatriate Iranian dissidents to locations where they were arrested or kidnapped and sent to Iran for imprisonment and execution.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The men also allegedly conspired to kidnap and/or lure a United States citizen, as well as victims residing in other countries. They allegedly hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on an individual in furtherance of a plot to kidnap or harm the victim based on their anti-regime activism. Noori allegedly facilitated payments to a private investigator in the United States in furtherance of the kidnapping plot.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In July of 2021, Noori, Farahani, Khazein, and Sadeghi were indicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on the charges listed above and federal warrants were issued for their arrests</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

            "details": "<p>Early on the morning of Thursday, March 6, 2008, a bomb exploded in front of the United States Armed Forces Recruiting Station in New York City’s Times Square. The device, which was built using an ammunition can similar to those found on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, was filled halfway with black powder and detonated using a time fuse. Although no one was wounded, the device could have caused significant injury and casualties if people had been close to the blast.</p>\r\n<p>The suspect rode a blue \"Ross\" bicycle west on 37th Street, took a right heading north on Sixth Avenue, and made a left heading west on 47th Street before turning left to head south on Seventh Avenue. The suspect got off the bike near the recruiting station at West 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue, placed the explosive device at the recruiting station, lit a fuse, returned to the bicycle, and fled the scene. The suspect rode the bike south on Broadway before making a left on 38th Street. The bike was later recovered in a dumpster near Madison Avenue and 38th Street.</p>\r\n<p>Although the suspect appears to be working alone, he or she may have had a lookout or surveillance team of as many as five individuals located in Times Square at the time the device was placed. The suspect was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt and pants of an unknown color. The height, weight, age, sex, and race of the suspect are unknown.</p>\r\n<p>Details of this bombing are similar to those of two other unsolved bombings that occurred in New York City, one at the British Consulate in May of 2005, and the other at the Mexican Consulate in October of 2007. All of the devices were delivered by an individual on a bicycle and were detonated between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. The incidents may be connected.</p>",

The couple never married and in June of 2001 the relationship ended. The two became embroiled in a very lengthy and aggressive custody-visitation dispute in the San Diego Family Court. In early November of 2004, the mother reportedly mentioned to the father that she and the children were planning a 2-week vacation in New Zealand. He told her that the trip would violate the court orders, and Fernandez's attorney was served with a notice of an ex-parte hearing scheduled for November 8, 2004.  At the hearing, a judge ordered that neither parent could take the children out of the jurisdiction of the court and that the children's passports were to be relinquished. The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.<br /><br />On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction. A federal arrest warrant was subsequently issued on February 4, 2005, in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, charging Fernandez with international parental kidnapping.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
